This project was a unique for me, as it was made to be used as an HTML5 iPad App. The informational &rdquo;app&ldquo; launched from an icon and used AngularJS for routing and no-refresh page transitions. It was a huge success and contributed to the client winning &rdquo;Best of Show&ldquo; at an American Water Works Association event with over 200 vendors.
