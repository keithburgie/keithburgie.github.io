Though I was originally hired as a WordPress developer, SchoolDude realized a different platform was needed to integrate their .NET SaaS product with their website and user community. They sent me to a crash-course DNN conference and I became the lead developer for this massive, responsive website overhaul for a (then) $50 million company.
