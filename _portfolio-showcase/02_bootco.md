Boot Co. is a premium footwear line from Timberland and the website was made to showcase the product in big, bold photos. I built a custom image slider that used thumbnails at desktop size and touch-friendly arrows for mobile. A desktop design was provided and it was my responsibility to create and build out the mobile experience.
