The website, a single page with blog functionality, was built to match a PSD using Jekyll, Foundation, Sass and jQuery. The responsive site features several large, parallax background images that were lazy-loaded to improve page load time. Blog posts are viewed through a custom slider that pulls next and previous article URLs into a lightboxed iframe.
