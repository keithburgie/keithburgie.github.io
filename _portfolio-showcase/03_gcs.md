Global Creative Services (GCS) is Timberland's in-house creative team and competes with outside agencies for within their own walls. This website serves as a work portfolio, employee directory, and RFP submission portal. The responsive site was a pencil-drawn wireframe when I arrived and I jumped at the opportunity to bring the site to life.
