On the heels of SchoolDude.com's completion, I was called on again as a contractor to build a DNN microsite for SchoolDude's annual user conference. It has since been replaced, as they build a new event site each year, but I really enjoyed the challenges of making this light and fun layout into something snappy and responsive.
